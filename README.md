# Neural Network using JS

## **Downloading**

---

Either clone this repo or download one of the releases.

```console repo
git clone https://github.com/notbtc2/neural-network.git
```

---

## **Running the Neural Network test**

---

### **1. Install an HTTP server or Go Live (VS Code)**

THIS STEP IS NOT NECESSARY BUT IT'S REALLY RECOMMENDED

Recommandable using a HTTP server either with HTTP-Server on node/yarn or if you're using VS Code the plugin Go Live is pretty useful.

Node :

```console node
npm i -g http-server
```

Yarn :

```console yarn
yarn add --dev http-server
```

### **2. Running index.html**

Simply double-click in `index.html` if you aren't using http-server or Go Live.

**· HTTP-Server** : <br>
If you're using node run this command on the project root folder:

```http-server node
npm http-server
```

If you're running yarn run this command on the project root folder:

```http-server yarn
yarn http-server
```

**· Go Live:** <br />
On the root folder while on VS Code click the Go Live button on the bottom left-hand corner.

## As easy as that you'll be running your own Neural Network simulation
